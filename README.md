# BeeBuds Description:
BeeBuds is an all-new social platform for Georgia Tech students that will enable them to discover fellow yellowjackets who share common interests, schedules, campus preferences, academic goals, and career aspirations! By calculating compatibility scores between users, BeeBuds offers students a robust list of peers who they'll find it easy to bond with! Whether you're a social animal or a bit more reserved, BeeBuds paves the way for the formation of ironclad friendships and unforgettable memories, so get ready to Buzz Away! 

#How does BeeBuds Work? 
BeeBuds allows users to assign a significance value (from 1 to 10) for a variety of matching categories such as pop culture interests to favorite dining hall. From there, we run a weighted average algorithm that places more precedence on the categories that a user deems as more important. Finally, a weighted percentage is calculated that acts as a compatibility score that will then be used to match yellowjackets!

#Vision
Our vision entails Yellowjackets across campus connecting, engaging, and expanding their social circle to unimaginable heights. We hope BeeBuds forges a treasured community that secures a future for boundless collaboration and innovation at Ramblin' Wreck County.
